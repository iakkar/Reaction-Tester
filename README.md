# Reaction-Tester

# Overview
Reaction Tester is a simple game that mainly tests the user's reaction times, by calculating the time it takes to click on the
objects that appear on screen. Each object differs in shape and position using a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). 
At each round's end the game displays the user's total time and the mean of correct clicks.
